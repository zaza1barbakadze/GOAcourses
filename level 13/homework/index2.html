<p1>Having a flexible body is one thing, but to be able to bend one's head backwards far enough to almost reach the ground, is quite an achievement.

One unusual aspect of his flexibility is how it extends to his internal organs as well, since he is shown to shift his heart to a different location so that Daki couldn't pierce through his heart.</p1>
